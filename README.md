- Shift logic: https://qr.ae/pvWj1O
- https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-translate-harmonica-tabs-written-for-a-C-song-into-something-that-I-can-play-on-an-F-harp-Or-an-A-harp-Those-are-the-only-two-I-have-at-the-moment


**Prerequisites**
- Python version used: 3.7.3
- The Melody Tab

**Considerations**
- The author doesn't have any musical background, take this with a grain of salt.

- You need to have sample.py and transposing_keys.py in the same folder.

- This tool only work for diatonic harmonicas. 

- Feel free to improve it to add other features, like chromatic harmonicas.



**How to use**
- Go to sample.py and edit source_key, target_key and melody with your tab key and notes.
- Run sample.py (I recommend echoing to a file in order to easily save the result)
